- define the data structures and logic in pure elixir
    - the entire app will be defined before even using the web framework
    - a finite state machine will be usedd to manage state transitions
- add in otp for concurrency and fault tolerance

- this tutorial builds a game called "Islands". Instead, I will make a game called "outline"
    - outline has pieces called "bullets"
    - "bullets" have
        - text (data)
        - tags (metadata)
        - children (relations) (ordered list)
    - moves include:
        - create a new bullet (at a location)
        - change a bullet's data
        - change a bullet's metadata
        - change a bullets "postition"
    - the "position" of a bullet is it's postiotion
    in the ordered list of its parent's children
